# Hello, World

Welcome to my blog. I'm Zeus Elderfield, a software developer based in the Philippines.

This is where I'll share thoughts on things I'm building, problems I've solved, and topics I find genuinely interesting — mostly around software, productivity, and the occasional deep dive into something obscure.

## What to expect

- **Project writeups** — breakdowns of side projects, what I learned, and what I'd do differently
- **Technical notes** — short posts on specific tools, patterns, or debugging sessions worth documenting
- **Misc thoughts** — anything else that doesn't fit neatly into a category

## Why bother?

Writing forces me to actually understand what I think I know. If I can't explain it clearly, I probably don't understand it well enough. This blog is as much for me as it is for anyone who stumbles across it.

Thanks for reading. More soon.
